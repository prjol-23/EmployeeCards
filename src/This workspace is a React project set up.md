This workspace is a React project set up with Vite as the build tool. It provides a minimal setup to work with React in Vite, including Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules for code quality.

### What does this project do?
This project is a web application that likely displays a set of cards based on the provided images in the `public` directory. The `Card.jsx` component probably renders these images in a card format, and the `App.jsx` file is likely the main entry point for the application.

### Why does this project exist?
The project exists to showcase how to set up a React application using Vite as the build tool. It aims to provide a fast development environment with HMR and ESLint rules for maintaining code quality.

### Main technologies, frameworks, languages used:
- React for building the UI components
- Vite for the build tool and development server
- ESLint for code linting
- Bootstrap and Reactstrap for styling and UI components

### Codebase organization:
- `public`: Contains static assets like images used in the application.
- `src`: Contains the source code of the application.
  - `App.jsx`: Main component rendering the cards.
  - `assets`: Directory for additional assets like JSON data and SVG images.
  - `Card.jsx`: Component for rendering individual cards.
  - `index.css`: Styles for the application.
  - `main.jsx`: Entry point for the application.
- `vite.config.js`: Configuration file for Vite.
- `.eslintrc.cjs`: ESLint configuration file.
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: Dependency management and scripts for building, linting, and running the application.

Overall, this project is a simple React application set up with Vite to display a set of cards, demonstrating a basic setup for a frontend web application.
